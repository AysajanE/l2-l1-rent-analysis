# Contracts changelog

All interface-relevant changes to canonical contracts must be recorded here.

Format:
- `YYYY-MM-DD` — what changed, why, and expected downstream impact.

Rules:
- If a change is interface-breaking, bump the contract version (e.g., `panel_schema_v2.yaml`) and add a migration note.

- 2026-01-22 — Added a minimal non-empty `contracts/schemas/panel_schema.yaml` stub so contract gates can prevent “comment-only” schemas.
