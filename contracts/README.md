# Contracts

Canonical, versioned specs that all downstream work must follow.

Examples:
- Project metadata (mode, primary question): `contracts/project.yaml`
- Empirical schemas and data dictionary: `contracts/schemas/`, `contracts/data_dictionary.md`
- Modeling specs and experiments: `contracts/model_spec.*`, `contracts/instances/`, `contracts/experiments/`
- Assumptions and decision logs: `contracts/assumptions.md`, `contracts/decisions.md`
