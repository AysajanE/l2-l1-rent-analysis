# Task T005 — Define workstreams + ownership boundaries

## Context

Parallel work only scales when ownership boundaries are explicit. Define workstreams and which paths/artifacts each workstream owns.

## Assignment

- Workstream: W0 Protocol (coordination)
- Owner (agent/human):
- Suggested branch/worktree name: `w0-workstreams`
- Allowed paths (edit/write): `.orchestrator/`, `docs/`
- Disallowed paths: `data/raw/` (append-only)
- Stop conditions (escalate + block with `@human`):
  - Any dispute about which workstream owns a shared artifact (schemas, registries, definitions)

## Inputs

- `.orchestrator/templates/workstreams_template.md`
- `docs/end_to_end_research_plan.md` (phase decomposition)

## Outputs

- Updated `.orchestrator/workstreams.md` with:
  - Workstream names
  - “Owns paths” / “Does NOT own” rules
  - Expected outputs per workstream
  - Quality gates per workstream (even if stubbed initially)

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Workstreams cover the full research lifecycle end-to-end
- [ ] Ownership boundaries are strict enough to prevent clashes
- [ ] `make gate` passes

## Validation / Commands

- `make gate`

## Status

- State: done
- Last updated: 2026-01-21

## Notes / Decisions

- 2026-01-21: Task created (bootstrap).
- 2026-01-21: Populated `.orchestrator/workstreams.md` with initial workstreams and ownership boundaries.
