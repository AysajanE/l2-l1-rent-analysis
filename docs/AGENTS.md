# docs/AGENTS.md — Documentation Rules

Docs are research-critical. Do not rewrite aggressively.

## Protocol lock is sacred

- `docs/protocol.md` defines canonical metrics, units, regimes, inclusion criteria.
- Only edit protocol if your task is explicitly W0 and authorizes it.

## Editing style

- Prefer minimal diffs.
- Preserve headings and structure.
- When adding a definition or rule, make it testable and unambiguous.

## Evidence discipline

If you add a factual claim that matters for measurement (e.g., upgrade date, fee semantics):
- add a short citation line or link in the doc
- record it in the task `Notes / Decisions` if it affects results

## No scope creep

Do not expand the research plan unless explicitly assigned.
