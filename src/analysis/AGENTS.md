# src/analysis/AGENTS.md — Analysis Rules

Analysis must be reproducible and must not silently fetch new data.

## Non-negotiables

- No network calls. Consume only local `data/processed/` artifacts.
- Deterministic outputs: fixed seeds where relevant.
- Every figure/table must be generated by code.

## Outputs

- Figures saved under `reports/figures/` with stable names.
- Any model outputs saved under `reports/tables/` or `reports/models/`.

## Documentation

Each analysis script/notebook must include:
- inputs it reads
- outputs it writes
- how to run
